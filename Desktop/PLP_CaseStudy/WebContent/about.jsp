		All of us wish to achieve financial freedom at some point in our life, and when it comes to doing that, we tend to believe that savings are enough to be financially stable. But, if you look at life from a practical perspective, you would understand that savings alone are not enough to achieve financial freedom; insuring your assets with general insurance policies is equally important.
        However, some people believe that they do not require general insurance policies as they can save enough money to replace their assets should anything happen to them. But, consider a situation when you have to wipe off all that you’ve saved all your life, just to pay for your medical bills or a car that is damaged beyond repair.
